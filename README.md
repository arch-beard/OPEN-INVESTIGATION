### U.N. data claims over 46 Million "refugees and asylees" are 'resettled' into the USA since 1951.

The U.N. specifically tallies refugees and asylees movement throughout the world, excluding other groups such as aliens who have arrived via border crossings, so called Got-a-Ways, migrants, or VISA overstays.  The figures presented by the U.N. are much higher than congressional ceilings allow.  Annual reports prepared by the U.S. government are only a fraction of what the U.N. claims.  Congress relies on accurate reporting and requires annual limits of refugees.  It appears Congress may not have all the necessary information.  This dataset contains all currently available data from the U.N. on refugees and asylees on the U.S. recorded as their final country of asylum, and also records the same level of granular data for every available nation in the U.N.'s database - current as of July 4th, 2024.  The disparaging differences in reporting require an open-investigation to first get at the truth.



### United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)

The UNHCR is a multilateral intergovernmental institution given a core mandate in 1949 established by the UN General Assembly.  Additional powers were granted by the Economic and Social Council [ESOSOC].  Through public international law and international treaty law, governments are obligated to cooperate involving the protection of refugees, and it intercedes directly on behalf of refugees and stateless persons.  UNHCR is also empowered to invite/solicit cooperation with varioius specialized agencies towards performance of its mandate.  UNHCR collaborates with Governments, develops partnerships with other international agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGO).  The UNHCR has established an interlocking network of collaboration that advances assistance and protection of refugees and asylees.

#### Definition of Refugees and Asylees do NOT include Migrants

The UNHCR states the term 'migrant' is not defined under international law, and the UN's involvement does not extend to 'migrants'. Two categories of people are covered by the UN: Refugees and Asylum-Seekers. The 'Refugee' is defined as anyone outside their country of origin for reasons of feared persecution, conflict, generalized violence or other circumstances that have seriously disturbed public order. The 'Asylum-seeker' is defined as anyone whose 'Refugee' status has not yet been determined by authorities, but whose claim to international protection entitles the individual to a certain protective status on the basis the individual 'could' be a 'Refugee', or where persons forming a large-scale influx of mixed groups in a situation where individual 'Refugee' status determination....is impractical. They may also be called 'prima facie' refugees.  However, as 'migrant' is not defined, such numbers are not recorded.  By definition, border crossers, migrants, so-called got-a-ways, VISA overstays, such people are not automatically included by definition.

#### On the Quality of UNHCR Data

The international data presented here is available through the UNHCR mandate, figures that extend by definition to Government collaboration.  There is no underlying reason currently identified that would either question UNHCR figures, or question the granular level of data such as Country of Origin information, annual totals, or figures identifying the small handful returned to their Country of Origin on any given year.  These figures should be considered definitive.



#### UNHCR Reveals Apparent Underreporting by U.S. Government

The U.N. data for the U.S. as country of asylum, when compared with official U.S. government reports prepared by OHSS, DHS and DOJ reveals apparent underreporting in all currently examined U.S. Government published reports.

Examination performed on the following OHSS, DHS and DOJ reports (1997-FY2022):

[Refugees and Asylees Annual Flow Report | Homeland Security]((https://www.dhs.gov/ohss/topics/immigration/refugees-asylees-afr))

  

It must be noted that refugee is a group congressionally restricted by annual ceiling. UNHCR figures for the U.S. systematically exceed the ceilings established by U.S. law.  This situation brings into question not only apparent underreporting by OHSS, DHS and DOJ, but the implications of annually breaking the congressional ceiling.  It would appear, Congress is unaware of these disparaging differences based on available reports.  This also brings into question a larger issue about those that prepared such reports, as well as if any laws may have been broken in the providing of potentially inaccurate information.  Those are questions for others to answer.  Regardless, IF U.S. reports on refugee admissions, and total individuals granted asylum affirmatively or defensively are in fact underreported in U.S. the available government reports, much larger questions begin to emerge - which may require an **Open-Investigation**.

### PURPOSE OF THIS REPOSITORY

This repository is supporting evidence, not only for the U.S., but for all available nations that have received refugees and asylees, managed or provided by the U.N. , that is data pulled direct from official U.N. database - through public API query as received in JSON format.  The raw data is also converted for wider usability into CSV and XLSX for use with common software such as Microsoft Excel and Open Office.



### Special Notes

While initial focus concerns refugees and asylees numbers for the U.S., the data is available on every nation and is published here.  Each dataset has invluable demographic data, such as the data field addressing Country of Origin.  Such information allows the expeditious tally of source demographics and much more in depth review.

In some instances, the U.N. did not present data for some countries. Positive and NULL responses are included within the dataset, and reflects the raw nature of the query.

  
The UNHCR uses the following country naming conventions through their API query, which does not align with standard Country ISO standard naming formats.
