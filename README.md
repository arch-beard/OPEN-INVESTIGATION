# OPEN-INVESTIGATION

				UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE AND ASYLEE PROGRAM - 1951 THRU 2022*


U.N. claims to have resettled over 46 Million "refugees and asylees" in the USA since 1951.

This claim does not consider aliens who have arrived via border crossing or Visa overstays.

Evidence provided by the U.N., obtained direct from official U.N. database - through public API query.

Data received from the U.N. is in JSON format, converted for convenience to CSV and XLSX.

While the focus of the investigation looks at "refugees and asylees" to the USA, the Country

of Origin data also seemed worthwhile.  As result, not only is data present surrounding inbound

activity to the USA, but this includes additional output from the U.N. database for each

and every nation that is recorded to have sent any 'refugees and asylees' to the USA, and includes

their inbound data on "refugees and asylees".

NOTE:  In some instances, the U.N. did not present "refugees and asylees" data for some countries.
Positive and NULL responses are included within the dataset.  
The following country naming conventions were used with the U.N. API query, which does not respond to
Country ISO standard naming formats.  Each query explicitly specified 1951-2023 to be included.
